In "The Holocaust in History", Michael Marrus explores the cause of the Holocaust through the lens of both Intentionalist and Functionalist arguments. He begins the article by offering some brief background information of the topic to the reader. Antisemitism was not a uniquely German or Nazi occurrence and was seen across Europe since the preceding century. However, Anti-Semitism became increasingly popular in Germany throughout the early 20th century. While the Nazi party was the most anti-Semitic party in German politics at the time, their platform was disorganized and lacked consistent goals, values, and messaging. As such, the Nazi’s policies concerning Jewish people lacked clarity. More surprisingly, Marrus mentions that very few prominent Nazi officials were openly anti-Semitic before 1925. Even after the Nazi’s seized power their ideology continued to lack consistency, mostly because Hitler often provided officials with very vague orders. Further, party elites were worried that anti-Semitism would harm Germany’s international reputation, while many party activists were actively hostile to Jews. Marrus than compares the Intentionalist and Functionalist arguments. Intentionalists believe that the Holocaust can be traced directly from Hitler’s hatred for Jews, and his long- standing desire to create a German “utopia”. On the other hand, Functionalists believe that the Holocaust was less centrally planned, and more the result of the institutions and individuals of the Third Reich trying to interpret their leader’s vague and disorganized orders.
