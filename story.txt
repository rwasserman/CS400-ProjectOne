I once was walking down the road and saw a gray bird. The bird was floating elegantly through the brisk fall air. As the bird continued flying, it slowly disappeared into the distance. Shortly after, it flew back with something in it's mouth. I was suprised to see that the bird was holding a raccoon. 

The raccoon smiled adn to my surprise he began to talk. His first words were "Hi, my name is Andy." I was shocked to hear the words come out his mouth and I ran back to my home as
fast as I could. My mother was there to greet me and she asked "have you seen what I sent you?"

So I went back to the bird and the racoon with my mother.  The bird was long gone but the racoon was in the same place still sitting there.  My mother bursted out laughing.  Confused, I went to the racoon.  After closer inspection I noctied it was just a stuffed racoon.
